The arc direction indicates the assumed causal direction, i.e. “A→B” means “A causes B.” A Missing Arc encodes the definitive absence of a direct causal effect, i.e. no arc between A and B means that there exists no direct causal relationship between A and B and vice versa. As such, a missing arc repre- sents an assumption 17.4.2 Indirect Connection A causes B via node C \\(A \\nupmodels B\\) and \\(A \\upmodels B|C\\) 17.4.3 Common Cause C causes both A and B \\(A \\nupmodels B\\) and \\(A \\upmodels B|C\\) 17.4.4 Common Effect C is the common effect of A and B \\(A \\upmodels B\\) and \\(A \\nupmodels B|C\\) 17.4.5 Example: Simpson’s Paradox 17.5 链接 因果推断 Google的因果分析包 "]
